Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

# I have created a project in the Ren'Py framework and I began working on a script. I have also begun collecting images to use for characters and backgrounds. I've also begun looking for open source data I can use in the project and ways to analyze the data using python (making plots, etc).

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

# I have not completed any plots using the open source data and I have yet to find enough backgrounds and characters for my visual novel. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

# I have not encountered any big problems thus far, however I am unsure how far I will get with the data analysis in python.
